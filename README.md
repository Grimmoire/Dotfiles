Ivory-Dotfiles
==============

Files with dots in front of (most of) them that I used for Arch Linux. I'm updating to a different color scheme because I've used this one for a year. I made this repo incase I don't like my new scheme. It's also for getting a fresh arch install for me up and running quickly and easily.
The colorscheme is mostly ivory with dark yellow and the fonts are M+
